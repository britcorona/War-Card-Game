# NSS War-Card-Game

### Goal

Create the card game War. *In Progress*

### Starting the war game application

##### Clone the repo

git clone https://github.com/britcorona/War-Card-Game.git

##### Install the HTTP Server

If you already have the server installed then skip this step.

The http-server module is just a very basic project that will serve static files from the directory of your choice.

*sudo npm install -g http-server*


##### Serve the application

Next, go to the War-Card-Game application root folder and start the server.

*http-server*

http://localhost:8080 (or whichever port it reports it is using) will display the application.

##### Install Bower

Go to the lib folder and *bower install*

##### Install Grunt

Still in the lib folder *npm install*

Now that everything is installed, make sure **Grunt** is running in the *lib folder* and the **http-server** is running in the applications *root folder*, and then it's time for war!
